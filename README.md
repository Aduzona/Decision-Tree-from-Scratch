# Decision-Tree-from-Scratch

This is the repo for my YouTube playlist ["Coding a Decision Tree from Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6DmpG_PtN0&list=PLPOTBrypY74xS3WD0G_uzqPjCQfU6IRK-). The goal is to code a decision tree classifier/regressor from scratch using just NumPy and Pandas.

PS: The “html_files”-folder is just included in the repo so that I can embed the notebooks into the respective [blog posts](https://www.sebastian-mantey.com/code-blog/coding-a-decision-tree-from-scratch-python-p1-introduction) on my website.
